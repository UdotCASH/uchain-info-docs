# UCHAIN.INFO Redesign

In 2024 we rolled out a **newly redesigned open-source UCHAIN.INFO explorer  ðŸŽ‰**!  [The frontend Github repository is available here](https://github.com/UdotCASH/uchain-info-frontend).

The redesign reimagines the blockchain explorer as a universal portal for exploring chain data, analytics, tools, apps, projects and more. Similar to a web 2.0 search engine, UCHAIN.INFO will provide a web3 engine for deep exploration of all aspects of a chain.&#x20;

Features include:

* **React frontend** redesigned from the ground up to allow for easier customizations and faster data rendering.
* **Rust microservices** provide code modularity and extend functionality with a more accessible language for web3 developers.&#x20;
* **My Account** section for customizable views, API keys, watch list, tags and custom smart contract interaction.
* **Custom transaction views** break down txs step-by-step to provide insight and transparency into each action performed.
* **DApp marketplace** featuring access to applications and on-chain projects.
* **Native DApp integrations** will include common ecosystem tools like swaps, access revoke, and multisender.
* **NFT dashboard** built for discoverability, tracking and trading.
* **API layer** designed for applications to quickly and confidently retrieve the data they need.
* **Advanced analytics** with a robust collection of charts to monitor network health, market data, smart contract views and more.
