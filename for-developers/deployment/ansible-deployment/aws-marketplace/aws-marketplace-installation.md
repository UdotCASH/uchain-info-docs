# Prerequisites & Install Parameters

## Installation Prerequisites:

#### Required:

1. **Valid email address:** You will receive a temporary password used to access your instance.
2. **Amazon EC2 Public Key (InstanceKey)**. You must create or upload a key pair to your AWS account. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
3. **ARNCertificate:** You must create or import an ssl certificate to the AWS Certificate Manager service. **This requires a registered domain name** you can access.
   * How to create a certificate: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html)
   * How to import an existing certificate: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html)
4. **Access to a full archive node running a blockchain with an EVM client**. The node will be connected during installation using the EthereumJsonRPC parameters. uchaininfo currently supports [Geth](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/getting\_a\_client.html), [Parity](https://wiki.parity.io/Setup), [RSK](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/Install-RskJ-and-join-the-RSK-Wasabi-Mainnet) and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart).
   * [Example Instructions on creating a local node are available here.](aws-ec2-archive-node-setup.md)

#### Optional: Route traffic following deployment:

If you leave the `CognitoCallbackDomain` parameter blank during installation and want to use your own domain later, you will need to route traffic to the LoadBalancer and change the Cognito App client settings.

A) Re-route your DNS

* Example instruction to route traffic using Route 53: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-elb-load-balancer.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-elb-load-balancer.html)

B) Configure Cognito settings

* Change the callback URL(s) in client settings. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-settings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-settings.html)

## AWS Installation:

See [Install from AWS Marketplace](install-from-aws-marketplace.md) for an installation walkthrough.

## Installation Parameters:

Most parameters can be left as default during installation. For a full list of variables see the [ENV variables list](../../../information-and-settings/env-variables.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
During configuration, the first item to input is **Stack Name.** This is an identifier that helps you find a particular stack from a list of stacks. It must start with an alphabetic character and can't be longer than 128 characters.
{% endhint %}

The following parameters require a user-input value.
