# Bug Bounty Program

Welcome to the Bug Bounty Program at UCHAIN.INFO! Ensuring the safety of our platform is a top priority, and we greatly appreciate the **crucial role security researchers play in contributing to open source**. Should you identify a possible security vulnerability within our platform, we invite you to join our bug bounty program and share your findings.

### How to report a security vulnerability

Send us an email with the information below. We ask that you please keep your findings confidential during the reporting process.  We will get back to you with our diagnosis or additional comments/questions within 10 days.

1.  **Description of the bug/vulnerability**

    Clearly describe the vulnerability you've discovered.
2. **Steps to reproduce**\
   Outline the steps needed to replicate the vulnerability.
3.  **Impact analysis**

    Assess the potential impact of the vulnerability on users, developers, and the organization.
4. **Code fix (optional)**\
   If possible and appropriate, you may include a suggested code fix for the vulnerability.
5.  **Type of vulnerability**

    Choose a label that best fits the category of the bug for classification purposes. This aids in rewards distribution and participation.&#x20;
6.  **Additional Context**

    Provide any additional information that could help in understanding and resolving the issue.
7. **Email your report**\
   Email your report to [security@uchain.info](mailto:%22security%40uchain.info%22%20%3Csecurity%40uchain.info%3E)

### Rewards &#x20;

If you are the first person to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on your findings, we will reward you with a bounty and mention in our [üèõSecurity Hall of Fame](bug-bounty-program.md#security-hall-of-fame)! Issue risk level is determined by our team.

1. **Critical Risk**: Up to $6000 in crypto equivalent.&#x20;
2. **High Risk**: Up to $1000 in crypto equivalent.&#x20;
3. **Moderate Risk**: Up to $500 in crypto equivalent.
4. **Low Risk**: Up to $100 in crypto equivalent.

All bounty researchers will be acknowledged (at your discretion) for your efforts in our documentation.
