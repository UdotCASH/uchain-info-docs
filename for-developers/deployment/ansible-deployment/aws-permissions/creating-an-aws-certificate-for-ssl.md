3\) Add a domain you have access to and click **Next**.

{% hint style="info" %}
This does not need to be the same domain for deployment - as long as itâ€™s a valid ARN on your account it will pass verification.
{% endhint %}

4\) Choose your validation method (your preference) and click **Review**.
