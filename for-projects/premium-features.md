# EaaS: Hosted Features

Hosted instances receive support and updates not available to non-hosted instances. If you have questions about integrating services or current premium integrations please ask in [Discord.](https://discord.gg/XmNatGKbPS)

:bullettrain\_side: **Hosting on uchain.info**: Self-hosting can be difficult, often requiring a dev-ops team to make critical in-house updates and/or customizations. A UCHAIN.INFO-hosted chain not only gives projects access to expert, dedicated technical support, it also greatly increases project visibility and provides access to the premium feature set.

:woman\_technologist: **Priority Updates:** The Ethereum mainnet uchaininfo instance is updated regularly with the latest functionality. Premium hosted versions of uchaininfo receive these same updates and patches. This includes community requested features, UI enhancements, protocol updates, fixes, and any other additions.

:man\_technologist: **Priority Support & SLA:** Premium customers receive personalized, priority assistance from the uchaininfo support team. The uchaininfo team responds to issues, requests, and bug reports from premium customers first and responds to your team's requests through a dedicated support channel.
